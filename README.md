# Unity Camera Controller (Third Person)

**Camera Controller functionality**

This controller will allow you to rotate around a given object with ctrl + mouse movement around the X axis. 

**Issues**

Camera will clip into the ground if object is at an awkward angle. Working on adding trigger collider to camera as well as raycasting
to determine how to move away from an object to avoid clipping.
